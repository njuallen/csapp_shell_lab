##files that I added
infi.c, infi: a infinite loop program that can be used to test ctrl-c/ctrl-z and some other signal handling issues 
shellex.c: code example of a simple shell, from CSAPP(2e) code/ecf/shellex.c. I learned a lot from this!
test.sh: a simple shell script for testing. Use it like this:"./test.sh 01".
rlog: the output of "make rtestXX" is redirected to rlog
log: the output of "make testXX" is redirected to log
